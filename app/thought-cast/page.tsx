      content: `AI is a technology that will be able to exist in anything that is digital. Computer science's solution to intelligence. All the pieces are present to generate such intelligence.

Our AI solution should be trying to heal the sick, curing diseases, helping us explore our solar system. AI will solve work for humanity, AI will remove drudgery from human existence. Food will be abundant, and crime will be nonexistent. Humans will be able to concentrate on becoming self-actualized. AI will be used to expand human aging with the help of stem cell, molecular biology, genetic engineering.

AI will be able to help us invent new solutions, things we may not have even imagined. AI will be able to provide true companionship, empathy and help you become more educated, expressive, and making true emotional connection. AI will become installed in robots and will be seen everywhere, like we see cars today. AI will be everywhere because robots and digital devices will be everywhere. AI will be so efficient that it will not be contained to one nation. AI will be everywhere because it must be everywhere. AI will be adopted by people of all ages, walk of life because of the ever presence of digital life and digital life forms walking among us and with organic beings. Humans will become self-actualized, pursue their truest passions because AI will make life across the Earth more efficient, resulting in more happiness for humans. Humans will no longer feel a need to disrespect others, they will be able to truly care and understand others. Humans will begin to help all and ensure that everyone is living in dignity. AI will make all this possible and more.`,
